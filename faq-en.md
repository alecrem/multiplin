> __Q:__ Why does the products deck not have all numbers from 1 to 100 in it?

__A:__ The game is designed to practise the multiplication table.

Some numbers that didn't make it to a product card are prime numbers greater than 10, such as 11 or 97, because they can't be found when multiplying two numbers between 1 and 10.

Some others that didn't make the cut are numbers that can't be produced by two factors lesser than 11, such as 22, 39 or 96.

| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|
| 2 |   | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10| 12| 14| 16| 18| 20|
| 3 |   |   | 9 | 12| 15| 18| 21| 24| 27| 30|
| 4 |   |   |   | 16| 20| 24| 28| 32| 36| 40|
| 5 |   |   |   |   | 25| 30| 35| 40| 45| 50|
| 6 |   |   |   |   |   | 36| 42| 48| 54| 60|
| 7 |   |   |   |   |   |   | 49| 56| 63| 70|
| 8 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 64| 72| 80|
| 9 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 81| 90|
| 10|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |100|

The figure above illustrates the way the suitable numbers for product cards were found.

> __Q:__ Why are there duplicates in the products deck?

__A:__ There are duplicate cards when a product card can be solved in more ways than other products.

All this is to make the game smoother and even the odds for most product cards to be solved. You might realise something about the square product cards, but before you ask let me say I think the game is fine in that regard. Feel free to think of that as a thing to be learnt that might make you better at playing the game.
